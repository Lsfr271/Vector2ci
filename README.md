# Vector2ci
## **-- v1.0**

## What is Vector2ci?
- Vector2ci is simply just a project to improve my skills in C++ by creating a dynamic array vector.
- Vector2ci is basically a copy of std::vector, its not meant to be used in code, but if you want
you can use it.

## How to install/use it if you are interested: (G++ is only supported currently on how to compile)

-1 Install [Vector2ci.hpp](https://github.com/Lsfr271/Vector2ci/blob/main/src/Vector2ci.hpp) or copy its file contents into your directory.

-2 Install [Vector2ci_functions.cpp](https://github.com/Lsfr271/Vector2ci/blob/main/src/Vector2ci_functions.cpp) or copy its file contents into your directory.

-3 Install [Vector2ci_operators.hpp](https://github.com/Lsfr271/Vector2ci/blob/main/src/Vector2ci_operators.hpp) or copy its file contents into your directory.

- After you have done that, you can include it like this:
- (INCLUDE ONLY the OPERATOR FILE AND THE MAIN HPP FILE)

```cpp
// change the include to your directory path
#include "../Vector2ci/Vector2ci.hpp"
#include "../Vector2ci/Vector2ci_operators.hpp"

int main() {
// code
}
```
